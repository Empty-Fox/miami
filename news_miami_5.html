            Miami Mayor Francis Suarez said the city would make digital wallets for its residents to dole out a “bitcoin
            yield” as a dividend directly from the city’s crypto, MiamiCoin, as part of its plan to become a
            cryptocurrency capital.

              Speaking with CoinDesk TV’s First Mover, Suarez <a
                href="https://twitter.com/CoinDesk/status/1458874317064843264?s=20" target="_blank"
                class="decorate_s">said</a> Miami would give a “bitcoin yield” from MiamiCoin
              as a dividend to its residents, who will get digital wallets from the city.</li>

            <li>
              MiamiCoin token has earned over $21 million for the city since its launch in August, which at this pace
              would generate roughly one-fifth of the city’s annual tax revenue, he said.</li>
            <li>

              Suarez expressed hopes that “at one point” down the road, his city could run “without taxes,” echoing
              his
              previous statements on the outcome of MiamiCoin.</li>

            <li>
              Earlier this month, Suarez tweeted he would take his next paycheck “100% in Bitcoin” — his office told
              Forbes on Thursday the mayor is paid in dollars, which is “immediately converted into Bitcoin” through
              an
              application.</li>

            <li>
              Paying government employees in Bitcoin was his top priority, Suarez told Bloomberg Technology last
              month,
              adding he also wants to allow Miami residents to pay their fees in Bitcoin.
            </li>
            <li>
              Florida’s law prohibits local governments from holding volatile assets, according to Bloomberg.
